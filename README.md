In this repository we shall be creating a working Model for predicting whether the following customer will continue its account in the bank or else will leave the Bank. Here the dataset is very huge, I.e., almost 10,000 instances or in simple word we can say as, information of 10,000 customers and so applying Machine Learning Algorithm directly on such huge datasets leads to the complexity in the processing speed and might end up with hang of your computer system. </br>

So, in order to overcome this Limitation, there was a need to have a Model which can </br>
